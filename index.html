            My vision for Bangladesh is a nation without poverty, where every
            person can unleash their potential. A future led by empowered women,
            innovative youth, and technology driving equitable progress. A
            sustainable Bangladesh, free from unemployment, inequality, and
            environmental harm, where social businesses replace traditional
            profit-driven models, creating opportunities for all. This vision is
            rooted in compassion, collective effort, and the belief that we can
            shape a prosperous, inclusive future for generations to come.
